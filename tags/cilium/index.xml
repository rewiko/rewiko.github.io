I got the chance to present &amp;ldquo;eBPF &amp;amp; Cillium at Sky&amp;rdquo; at Kubecon 2021, we are explaining how we have been embracing EBPF and Cilium at Sky and how our automated tests help us to mitigate the risk of introducing new technology without affecting tenants of the platform and ultimately our customers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Network Policies - Cilium &amp; EBPF</title><link>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/kubernetes-network-policies/kubernetesnetworkpolicies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/kubernetes-network-policies/kubernetesnetworkpolicies/</guid><description>Secure your network with network policies Kubernetes comes with a flat network by default where every pod can talk to each other.

Initially Calico was relying on iptables rules to block/allow ingress/egress traffic related to your pod.</description></item></channel></rss>
