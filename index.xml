I got the chance to present &amp;ldquo;eBPF &amp;amp; Cillium at Sky&amp;rdquo; at Kubecon 2021, we are explaining how we have been embracing EBPF and Cilium at Sky and how our automated tests help us to mitigate the risk of introducing new technology without affecting tenants of the platform and ultimately our customers.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Cross Cluster Communication</title><link>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/cross-cluster-communication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/cross-cluster-communication/</guid><description>Kubernetes Cross Cluster Communication Depending on your requirements and needs, you might not need cross cluster communication at the pod level.
In most cases, stateless components are running within your cluster and talking to some stateful components like databases which are running outside of the cluster. This is a common approach right now because it is still very difficult to run stateful components on a kubernetes cluster even if some solutions exist like statefulsets which add ordering and stable dns for your pods.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Network Policies - Cilium &amp; EBPF</title><link>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/kubernetes-network-policies/kubernetesnetworkpolicies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/kubernetes-network-policies/kubernetesnetworkpolicies/</guid><description>Secure your network with network policies Kubernetes comes with a flat network by default where every pod can talk to each other.
Kubernetes Network Policy is a concept which allows you to segregate the network within your cluster.
Multiple CNI are available to implement network policies. Cilium and Calico are the main CNI available to secure your network.
Initially Calico was relying on iptables rules to block/allow ingress/egress traffic related to your pod.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rewiko.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>Hello,
I&amp;rsquo;m Anthony Comtois and I have been working in IT for over 10 years.
