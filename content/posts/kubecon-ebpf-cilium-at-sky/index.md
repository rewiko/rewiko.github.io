## Kubecon EBPF & Cilium at Sky Presentation

In addition to the "EBPF Summit 2021 - Presentation" and my previous post about [Cilium & EBPF]({{< ref "/posts/kubernetes-network-policies/kubernetesnetworkpolicies" >}} "Cilium & EBPF").

I got the chance to present "eBPF & Cillium at Sky" at Kubecon 2021, we are explaining how we have been embracing EBPF and Cilium at Sky and how our automated tests help us to mitigate the risk of introducing new technology without affecting tenants of the platform and ultimately our customers.

I hope you will enjoy it.
