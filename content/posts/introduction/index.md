Hello, 

I'm Anthony Comtois and I have been working in IT for over 10 years.

I have seen various entreprise types: large, medium, small startup. 

I like being delivery focus and thinking about the full picture of a project to improve it and going forward.

I'm working on a few blog posts, you can subscribe to the <a href="/posts/index.xml" target="/">RSS feed <i class="fas fa-rss-square"></i> </a> to get notified.

I will share my knowledge which can hopefully help others.
