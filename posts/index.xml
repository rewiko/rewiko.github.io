I&amp;rsquo;m Anthony Comtois and I have been working in IT for over 10 years.
I have seen various entreprise types: large, medium, small startup.
I like being delivery focus and thinking about the full picture of a project to improve it and going forward.
I&amp;rsquo;m working on a few blog posts, you can subscribe to the RSS feed to get notified.
I will share my knowledge which can hopefully help others.</description></item></channel></rss>
